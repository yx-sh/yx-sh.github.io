## About Me

Firstly, I just wanted to say “Hello” and “Thank you” for stopping by.

My name is Yuxi (she/her). I’m a graduated student in logic and philosophy of science, and I strive to become a data analyst or a software engineer. I am interested in making data work, whether that means collection, visualization, modeling, or deployment, and studying how to develop a variety of applications. My main areas of focus are data analysis(Python, SQL, and R) and backend development (Java). 

Outside work, I read (mostly on logic and philosophy, contemporary Chinese literature), play games like Kerbal Space Program, Octopath Traveler, and Destiny 2. I’m also interested in watching football and the crypto asset industry.



## About This Site


I am planning this site as more of a place for me to motivate myself to learn new things and keep notes on what I learn, so that I can share knowledge and ideas with others and improve my writing skills. How-to tutorials, programming, notes on algorithms and data structures, rationales and random thoughts in my life —all of that will live here.

**Please note this is my personal website. My view's on this website are separate from my (potential) employer’s.**

If you find anything of use in my random stuff - glad that I could be of service. :-)
